    <h2>About recipe</h2>
    <p>A sweet and refreshing strawberry milkshake is the perfect drink for summer. They can be enjoyed as a healthy breakfast beverage, 
        for an energizing snack or even as a light(er) dessert. 
        Here I share with you two different but equally delicious ways to make my favorite strawberry milkshake recipe – a classic shake prepared with milk, 
        and a plant-based vegan version made with almond milk.</p>

        <p>Not only are strawberries great to bake with, they’re terrific to include in other dishes like Fruit Salad and many no-cook summer recipes. When I have an abundance of strawberries but don’t have the time (or simply don’t feel like) cooking, this strawberry milkshake is my go-to way to use fresh berries.

            Not only are fruit shakes delicious, they are easy to make in just 10 minutes with a handful of wholesome and tasty ingredients.
            
            Plus, you can customize this recipe of strawberry milkshake to fit your tastes</p>
